The idea for my personal website is to share my cooking experience with others in blog, 
so my target audience will be someone who starts to study or try cooking. 
My main page will share the recipes of dishes, 
one of the child pages will be the safety guidelines in the kitchen, 
and the others child pages will be the Food Photography for everyone to submit.
