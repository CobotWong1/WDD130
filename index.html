  <h2>Cobot</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone, you can call me Cobot and I come from Hong Kong. I am 24 and I was born in church.</p>
  <p>My goal is to get a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology, and Web Fundamentals is my second class </br>in pursuing the certificate in Web & Computer Programming, I hope I can get my first certificate.</p>
  <p>Every sport is my favourite, but basketball is the most I played with friends. I am also self-studying in Japanese because 
    I like joining </br>idol group activities, seeing their concert and watching their entertainment show, the image above is one time I joined a concert in Japan.</p>
  <p>I wish everyone all the best this semester, thank you.</p>
